      Popularity-contest Frequently Asked Questions.

Q) My submissions bounce with 
   550 [PERMFAIL] popcon.debian.org requires valid sender domain.

A) popularity-contest send the report as root but the email adress of the root
   user was not configured properly. With exim, you can
   add an entry for root in /etc/email-addresses with a suitable
   adresse.

   A better fix would be to change popcon.debian.org to not reject emails with
   invalid sender domain in the first place, but it is out of our reach for the
   time being.

Q) /usr is mounted with 'noatime'.

A) popularity-contest use atime to know what packages were used during
   the last month. This mean you will only report the list of packages installed
   without usage information.
