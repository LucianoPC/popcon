_Description: Participate in the Debian Package Popularity Contest?
 You can have your system anonymously e-mail the Debian developers with
 statistics about your most used Debian packages.
 .
 This information helps us make decisions such as which packages should go
 on the first Debian CD.  Also, we can improve future versions of Debian so
 that the most popular packages are the ones which are installed
 automatically for new users.
 .
 If you choose to participate, the automatic submission script will
 run once every week automatically, e-mailing statistics to the Debian
 developers.
 .
 You can always change your mind after making this decision:
 "dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest"
 .
 (NOTE: e-mail servers add their own tracing information and your data
 won't be completely anonymous while in transit.)

 The install script could not generate a unique host identifier.
 This is a fatal error, as all hosts submitting information need to have
 an unique identifier.

 Please report this problem as a bug against the popularity-contest
 package, and include information about your configuration.
