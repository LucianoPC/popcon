_Description: Debian Package Popularity Contest
 You can have your system anonymously e-mail the Debian developers with
 statistics about your most used Debian packages.
 .
 This information helps us make decisions such as which packages should go
 on the first Debian CD.  Also, we can improve future versions of Debian so
 that the most popular packages are the ones which are installed
 automatically for new users.
 .
 If you choose to participate, the automatic submission script will run
 once every week automatically.
 .
 You can always change your mind after making this decision:
 "dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest"
 .
 (NOTE: e-mail servers add their own tracing information and your data
 won't be completely anonymous while in transit.)
