Description: Debian Package Popularity Contest
 You can have your system anonymously e-mail the Debian developers
 with statistics about your most used Debian packages.
 .
 This information helps us make decisions such as which packages
 should go on the first Debian CD.  Also, we can improve future
 versions of Debian so that the most popular packages are the ones
 which are installed automatically for new users.
 .
 If you choose to participate, the automatic submission script will
 run once every week automatically.
 .
 You can always change your mind after making this decision:
 "dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest"
 .
 (NOTE: e-mail servers add their own tracing information and your data won't
 be completely anonymous while in transit.)
