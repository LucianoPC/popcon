.SH "NAME"
popularity\-contest \- list the most popular Debian packages
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B popularity\-contest
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B popularity\-contest
command gathers information about Debian packages installed on the system,
and prints the name of the most recently used executable program in that
package as well as its last\-accessed time (atime) and last\-attribute\-changed
time (ctime) to stdout.
.PP 
When aggregated with the output of
.B popularity\-contest
from many other systems, this information is valuable because it can be used
to determine which Debian packages are commonly installed, used, or
installed and never used.  This helps Debian maintainers make decisions such
as  which packages should be installed by default on new systems.
.PP 
The resulting statistic is available from the project home page
http://popcon.alioth.debian.org/.
.PP 
Normally,
.B popularity\-contest
is run from a
.BR cron (8)
job,
.BR /etc/cron.weekly/popularity\-contest ,
which automatically emails the results to Debian package maintainers
according to the settings in
.BR /etc/popularity\-contest.conf .
