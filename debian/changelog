popularity-contest (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Added Japanese debconf translation thanks to Kenshi
      Muto. (Closes: #229538)
    - Make sure /etc/popularity-contest.conf is readable by user
      nobody, no matter the umask of root.
    - Drop the intro note, and show the explanation as part of the
      participate question. (Closes: #229573)
    - Update Norwegian Bokmål debconf translation.
    - Remove the question asking if it is ok to edit MAILTO address,
      and move the default values into
      /usr/share/popularity-contest/default.conf. (Closes: #229288, #229111)

      /var/log/popularity-contest is missing.

      Bart Cornelis. (Closes: #217038)
    - Add URLs to the project home page in manual page and README file.
    - Make it possible to reconfigure this package by calling
      'dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest', to get the code in
      base-config working as it should. (Closes: #228535).
      This should still fix bug #135273, as the current PARTICIPATE
      value is taken from the current config file, and only that
      variable is modified if the user using debconf change the value.
    - Collect and report the content of /etc/debian_version.
    - Start using generic address survey@popcon.debian.org. (Closes: #206830)
    - Ask if the submit address should be changed on upgrades and
      reconfigures.  This should activate the new address on old
      installations.
    - Updated all translation files with the new question text.
    - Started on Norwegian Bokmål debconf translation (no.po).
  * Bill Allombert
    - control: change exim to exim4. (Closes: #228575)
    - Update documentation to refer to popcon.debian.org.

    - Rewrite popularity-contest in perl.
      No user-visible changes outside speed.
    - Don't use dpkg-architecture anymore. (Closes: #212736)

popularity-contest (1.3-1.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * NMU.
  * Do not ship /etc/popularity-contest.conf; don't change it using
    debconf if it already exists; don't mark it as a conffile (since we
    don't ship it any more).  (Closes: #135273)
    This should be sufficient to get popularity-contest back into woody.
  * #136510 appears to have been fixed in 1.2 or 1.3-1.  (Closes: #136510)
    (If you want to participate question is now boolean.)

popularity-contest (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow overriding the From: and Sender: headers in outgoing mail by
    adding a new MAIL_FROM variable in /etc/popularity-contest.conf.  Also
    drop to user "nobody" before running.  Closes: #89530, #39501, #69823, 
    #74809, #57257, #57709, #65218.  Okay, this was obviously a popular
    request, but if people would just configure their mailers not to use
    invalid From: lines by default, they would be a lot happier.
    
  * Added a popularity-contest.8 manpage.  Closes: #39501.
  
  * Updated README.  Closes: #105668.

    sender.  Fixes bug#31205.
    
  * Actually even version 0.1-2 saved the popcon results to a log file, so
    that fixes bug#44801.
    
  * Uses a more unique ID string than just the hostname, and it persists
    across hostname changes.
