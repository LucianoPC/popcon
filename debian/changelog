popularity-contest (1.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for reporting using http POST to a list of URLs.
    Uploading using content-type text/plain, content-encoding
    x-gzip, with 30 second timeout. (Closes: #239097)
  * HTTP submissions are enabled by default for new installs, but
    disabled by default for upgrades.
  * New client script /usr/share/popularity-contest/popcon-upload.
  * New server CGI /usr/share/doc/popularity-contest/popcon.cgi.
  * Added simple FAQ entry about the http POST feature.
  * Code done by Bill Allombert.  Patch based on code from Ubuntu,
    though reimplemented in perl to avoid python dependency.  The
    ubuntu versions are included in the source package as
    popcon-submit-ubuntu.cgi and popcon-upload-ubuntu.
  * Added low priority debconf question asking if http should be used.
    Only ask this question if participating.
  * Rewrote the participation template text, to only talk about
    submissions and not emails, making it neutral to the submission
    method used.
  * debian/cron.weekly:
    - Try to run /usr/share/popularity-contest/popcon-upload if
      USEHTTP is enabled
    - Do not send email if http POST method was successfull.
    - Do not run sendmail if it is not available, to work without
      mail-transport-agent.  Redused depend on mail-transport-agent to
      recommends, as the default for new installs is HTTP, and
      existing installations are expected to already have
      mail-transport-agent installed.
  * Depend on ${misc:Depends} instead of debconf, to get the updated
    debconf dependency.
  * Rewrote popularity-contest to use dpkg-awk if dpkg-query is
    missing.  This make it compatible with dpkg versions before 1.10,
    getting it to work on woody, sarge, etch and sid.  Drop versioned
    dependency on dpkg because of this.
  * Implemented sending of compressed MIME emails when recommended
    package mime-construct is installed.  Disabled until the server
    side is implemented. (Debian bug #149425)
  * Add info in README about the linux counter. (Closes: #259004)
  * Updated to Standards-Version 3.6.2.  No changes required.
