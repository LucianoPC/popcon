Description: Vote for your favourite packages automatically
 The popularity-contest package sets up a cron job that will
 periodically anonymously submit to the Debian developers
 statistics about the most used Debian packages on this system.
 .
 This information helps us making decisions such as which packages 
 should go on the first CD. It also lets us improve future versions
 of Debian so that the most popular packages are the ones which are
 installed automatically for new users.
